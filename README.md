# Minecraft Wall Blender

This is a tool to help you design walls in Minecraft by blending different blocks randomly.

## How to Use

1.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2.  Set the desired `width` and `height` of the wall.
3.  Configure the blocks you want to use and their blend ratios.
    *   You can use the default colored blocks (`red.png`, `green.png`, `blue.png`).
    *   You can upload your own texture images by clicking the `Choose Image` button for each block type. The file name will be used as the block type name.
4.  Click `Add Block` to add more block types.
5.  Click the `Generate` button to see the blended wall rendered on the canvas below.

## Notes

*   Uploaded images are not saved. They will be gone if you reload the page.
*   The block textures are rendered at a size of 16x16 pixels on the canvas.
